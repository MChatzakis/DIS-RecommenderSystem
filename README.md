## Context
This repository contains a solution to a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dis-project-2-recommender-system/) competition of Distributed Information Systems course of EPFL. The competition is about the creation of a Recommendation Engine for the MovieLens dataset, which is automatically evaluated in the competition using RMSE.

## Approach
We describe our approach in our report (report/Report.pdf), as well us our final submission notebook (src/kaggle.ipynb). Briefly, we utilize an optimized Matrix Factorization approach to generate user rating predictions.
